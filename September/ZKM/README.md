**USE CASE: Rental Payments and Verifications**

ZKM could be useful for making rental payments and managing tenant-landlord relationships making them more efficient and private. Tenants can prove they've paid rent on time without revealing their exact financial details or transaction history, but still have a verifiable record of payments.They could make payments in whatever cryptocurrency they prefer, and landlords could receive it in their preferred form.
The zkMIPS proofs could also help with things like proving income for rental applications without showing your whole financial history, or verifying a good rental history without exposing all the details of past tenancies.
